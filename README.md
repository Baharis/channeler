# channeler
A minimal python3 package designed for quick splitting and merging
colour channels of png pictures. 

To test the code, run the file channeler.py without further modifications.
Image 'example.png' should be split into four layers containing
information about red, green, blue and transparency.
Afterwards image 'merged.png' should be created from these layers
arranged in different configuration. Adapt the code to your preferences.
